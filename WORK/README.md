## Simple and efficient AI

Nature teaches us 
Learning and computations can be accelerated using sparse binary vectors. In a nutshell:
- We can combine semantic vectors with symbolic algebra 
- Simpler operations mean compression and more efficient compute

## Applications
- **Fast fuzzy search** within large datasets was developed and proven on behavioural, medical and GPS datasets
- **AI systems learning via one shot learning**. Unique feature is the ability to perform super fast unsupervised learning of any, multidimensional sequences from multidimensional datasets 
- **Efficient Learning** in term of scores and energy.  
Here we are interested in binary deep learning architectures, preprocessings via sparse vectors and computer architectures optimised for sparse binary computations.
