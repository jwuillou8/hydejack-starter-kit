* Real life data is sparse and messy
* In many instances, real world systems require simple, fast and fuzzy solutions
* The ability to build simple memories allow to execute abstract queries at record speed
 
Mixing high dimensional computing with symbolic logic, one delivers elegant solutions, achieving cheaper computing with unequaled performance with high compression rates.

Applications included GPS processing, behavioural and medical data. 
Contact us for more information or to run a pilot.
