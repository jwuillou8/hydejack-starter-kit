Deep Learning and HD computing have very distinct qualities and advantages. 

I am running several experiments to compare these and also integrate both technologies.

My work includes binary neural networks, binary embeddings and application of these strategies to various datasets.
For instance, in certain cases we found that classification scores could be improved
by using the above mentionned approaches. 

#By using High dimensional computing to model data, we empirically found that classification scores could be improved or/and computational ressources reduced.
