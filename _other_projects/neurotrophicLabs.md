# Neurotrophic Labs

With Jeremy Martinez, a californian MD, 
we have called neurotrophic Labs a collaboration aiming at
developing innovative solutions for MD's.

We have called NL a flexible technological solution to help MD’s to take data based decisions in real time.

With this work, we are trying to support Doctors decision making, which should impact positively on individual health and finance.

## App:
We have built an innovative prototype processing 5 millions US patient histories of the medicare research dataset. 
This architecture allows MDs to model simple scenarios and get basic correlations from real data very quickly.

We list below the innovative aspects of the approach:
####  Easy design of scenarios & hypotheses
A combination of symbolic algebra and neurocomputing techniques allows for a seamless modelling of patients.
The app allows with autocompletion to enter several profile and diseases combinations.

#### Live Data based evaluation
We could process the whole data set described above within
~1 second on a middle sized machine. 

#### Online Learning 
The user can train the app, editing and creating patient profiles to teach the app via examples.


#### Neuromorphic ”Engine”
Patients histories are modeled as binary fingerprints, allowing for 
fuzzy matchings either by profile or by disease.

Aside of the speed and flexibility, the other strength of the approach is the complete robust against false negatives
(the system will have perfect matches against critical diseases).

## Team:

We are experienced consultants covering both medical and AI/technical spaces.
